Ready to get your hands dirty? Now it's quite easy :)

Make sure you have Android SDK, ant, and git installed.

You can update android.library.reference.1 property in project.properties,
which should point to GreenDroid library location. By default, it is set
to be found two levels up from your ubuntuone-android-files branch
named, for instance, my_new_branch:

/home/user/.../code/ubuntuone-android-files/my_new_branch
/home/user/.../code/GreenDroid
/home/user/sdk/android-sdk

The library will be downloaded for you, if it's not there yet.

The tools directory from your Android SDK should be in your path.
You can check that with:
$ echo $PATH
If it's not there, run:
$ PATH=$PATH:/home/user/sdk/android-sdk/tools
with the appropriate location of your Android SDK.

Kewl. New the fun part!

$ ant setup
will download all necessary dependencies (couple of jars and GreenDroid).

$ ant debug
will compile the project and create an apk signed with your debug key

$ ant install
will install that apk onto your running emulator / plugged in device.

Enjoy and happy hacking!

--- Developers note ---

If you add new downloadable jar files to the project, please add a wildcard to
.bzrignore to match it in libs/ , and "bzr remove" the existing file if
it's in the branch.

If you have fixed a bug or implemented a new feature, commit your code and
$ bzr push lp:~your_username/ubuntuone-android-files/your_branch_name
Go to launchpad, click 'Propose merge' and describe what you've changed.
Once you're done and confirm, we'll review your code and hopefully merge to trunk! :)
